## 🧑‍💻 About me
I'm a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in architecture design and development with strong problem-solving skills. I'm functional programming enthusiast and advocate of creating simple and maintainable code. I have strong self-organization and time-management skills. 
I'm interested in building powerful, reactive, concurrent, and distributed applications. I have extensive knowledge of different programming languages, architectural patterns and the principal development frameworks.
However, there is always room for improvement so I'm constantly looking to explore new ideas, learn from my peers, have new experiences and engage with new challenges.

Hammock is yet another HTTP client for Scala. It tries to be typeful, purely functional, and work along other technologies that you're already using such as akka-http, circe, or cats.
