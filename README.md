## 🧑‍💻 About me
🔭 I'm a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in architecture design and development with strong problem-solving skills. I'm functional programming enthusiast, creating simple and maintainable code. I have strong self-organization and time-management skills. 

⚡ I'm interested in building powerful, reactive, concurrent, and distributed applications. I have extensive knowledge of different programming languages, architectural patterns and the principal development frameworks.

✨ However, there is always room for improvement so I'm constantly looking to explore new ideas, learn from my peers, have new experiences and engage with new challenges.

_"Programming is science, art, and engineering."_

Hammock is yet another HTTP client for Scala. It tries to be typeful, purely functional, and work along other technologies that you're already using such as akka-http, circe, or cats.
